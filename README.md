# Post-API Project
The project was developed using **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The purpose of this project is to create a simple application that interacts with a post API.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in the development of this project:

* **TypeScript:** TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides static typing, which helps catch errors and provides better tooling for large-scale applications.
* **React:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and build interactive UIs.
* **TailwindCSS:** Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable CSS framework that provides a utility-first approach. It enables rapid UI development by providing a set of pre-defined utility classes.
