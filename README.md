Post-API Project
This is the README file for the Post-API project. The project was developed using TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. The purpose of this project is to create a simple application that interacts with a post API.

Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in the development of this project:

TypeScript: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides static typing, which helps catch errors and provides better tooling for large-scale applications.
React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and build interactive UIs.
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable CSS framework that provides a utility-first approach. It enables rapid UI development by providing a set of pre-defined utility classes.
Project Description
The Post-API project is a simple application that interacts with a post API. It allows users to perform various operations on posts, such as creating a new post, reading existing posts, updating posts, and deleting posts.

The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can view a list of posts, add new posts, view the details of individual posts, update existing posts, and delete posts. It utilizes the post API to send requests and receive responses for performing these operations.
